Implement proper communication of screen size to systems (consider indirection through logical space)
Correctly handle registration for separate iterators for disparate entity sets (e.g. fish Demographics on world entity, fish description on fish themselves)
Introduce SwimSystem
Decide how to handle changing sprite sheet when fish is moving

Factor out static data so it isn't copied to every entity instance (e.g. sprite sheet dimention info)
Remove EntityId from components, maybe world too?
Actually call system update methods in parallel
Separate out ECS base functionality from fishing use
