Decide how to handle changing sprite sheet when fish is moving

Factor out static data so it isn't copied to every entity instance (e.g. sprite sheet dimention info)
Remove EntityId from components, maybe world too?
Actually call system update methods in parallel
Separate out ECS base functionality from fishing use
